# Interlude-2 
# Reflection
> Now that we have completed Module 2, I would have to say I greatly enjoyed learning about the different technqiues and ideas over the past month. I found some areas to be more interesting than others, but overall I am glad to have participated in the various websites and creative programming lessons. While I did not have a personal favourtie instructional day, as they were all excellent in compiarision to one another, I would however say I learned great ideas and morals from the module. The most crucial one in my opinion would have to be the one that specifies the importance of gameplay in history. The main reason for why

> The class that I participated in on October 19th, is the only one where I accumulated any assignments for this Module. In it, I was instructed to partake in crafting my own Augmented Reality assignment. Below are some screenshots of my work at various stages. Unfortunately, I ran into some trouble with the assignment, the likes of which inculded me not completing a version of the assignment that satisifed me with its progress until October 27th, during Reading Week. I originally believed I had properly developed the various aspects of the assignement during my first attempt of it in class, but realized there were a lot of bugs and problems that went along with it. I intially tried to fix it a couple of days later, but found I had trouble articulating the exact mechanics of how the assignment should work. The links were broken and I was unable to see what I had been able to design.
However, several days after these two attempts, I try to restart the assignment from the original format from the instructions I was provided. Thankfully, I did not have to bother anybody to provide me with assistance, as I was able to fully craft the assignment the way it was meant to be performed. I cannot say if it is an exact, perfect example of the finished project, but I am nevertheless proud of myself for all the hard work I put into this assignment. I would say, looking back at the assignment now, I am glad I was able to finish it to an area I deemed acceptable, as even I may not be particuarly gifted when it comes to computer mechanics and how coding and formatting websites and online resources, I feel I completed this assignment to the best of my ability.
I do not believe I will be using an Augmented Reality assignment in my Unessay, but I am still happy I learned how to use the software regardless. After all, I believe it was the great Professor Graham who deemed it was not the finished product that mattered, but rather the expeirence we gained experimenting with the software along the way.
